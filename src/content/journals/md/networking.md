## Key Concpets

**Communication Node:** has the ability to send and receive messages  
**Communication Channel:** A physical medium through an encoded  message is transmitted using physical signals.
**Encoded message:** a message transformed from one medium/format to another medium/format  
**Binary bit ($\beta$) :** is the digital representation of a physical signal, 1 = active signal , 0 = inactive signal.  
**Packet:** the number of bytes $\mathbf{B}$ required to encode a message  
**Rate:** the number of bits a communication channel can transmit over a period of time.  
**Network:** is a system of interconnected communication channels connecting communication devices  
**Bottleneck:** is where two or more communication channels merge into one.  
**Bandwidth:** The  
**Throughput:** The actual amount of successfully transferred data through a communication channel.  
**Bottleneck:** The point in which multiple communication channels merge into one, this  
**Multiplexing:** A technique used to try and a
**Demultiplexing:**  A process used to extract the multiple signals from a communication channel.

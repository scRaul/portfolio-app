## Section 1

If you stretch a rubber band, a force tries to pull the rubber band back to its equilibrium, or unstretched, length. A force that restores a system to an equilibrium position is called a **restoring force**. Objects that exert restoring forces are called **elastic**. The most basic examples of elasticity are things like springs and rubber bands, but other examples of elasticity and restoring forces abound. For example, the steel beams flex slightly as you drive your car over a bridge, but they are restored to equilibrium after your car passes by. Nearly everything that stretches, compresses, flexes, bends, or twists exhibits a restoring force and can be called elastic.
We didn’t introduce restoring forces in Part I of this textbook because we didn’t have the mathematical tools to deal with them. But now—using work and energy—we do. We’re going to use a simple spring as our model of elasticity. Suppose you have a spring whose **equilibrium** length is ${L_0}$. This is the length of the spring when it is neither pushing nor pulling. If you stretch (or compress) the spring, how hard does it pull (or push) back? Measurements show that

- The force is *opposite the displacement*. this is what we mean by a restoring force.
- If you don't stretch or compress the spring too much, the force is *proportional to
the diplcaement from equilibruim*. The farther you push or pull, the larger the force.

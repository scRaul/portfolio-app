## Key Concpets

- **Communication Node**: has the ability to send and receive messages  
- **Communication Channel**: A physical medium through an encoded  message is transmitted using physical signals.
- **Encoded message**: a message transformed from one medium/format to another medium/format  
- **Binary bit**:($\beta$) is the digital representation of a physical signal, 1 = active signal , 0 = inactive signal. $b$ represents a sequence of bits.  
- **Packet**: consists of a header and payload, its size is the number of bytes $B$ required to encode a message  
- **Rate**: the number of bits a communication channel can transmit over a period of time.  
- **Network**: is a system of interconnected communication channels connecting communication devices  
- **Bandwidth**: A communication channel's theoritical max rate.  
- **Throughput**: The actual amount of successfully transferred data through a communication channel.  
- **Bottleneck**: The point at which multiple communication channels merge into one.  
- **Multiplexing**: A technique used to try effeinciently send multiple signals past a bottneck point. E.g transmitting at defferent frequency ranges and or time slots  
- **Demultiplexing**:  A process used to extract the multiple signals from a communication channel.  
- **Collision Domain**: A the domain of communication nodes that share a communication channel, at the shared channel, each communication node has the potential to interupt another node from transmitting a message.  
- **Half Duplex Mode**: When a commication device can both send and recieve but is restricted to only doing one at a time.  
- **Full Duplex Mode**: When a communcation device is allowed to both send and recieve at the same time.

\textbf{Bit unit table}\\
\begin{align*}
\beta &= \set{1,0} \\
b & = count(\beta) \\
Kb & = 10^3 \cdot b \\
Mb & = 10^6 \cdot b \\
Gb & = 10^9 \cdot b \\
Tb & = 10^{12} \cdot b \\
Pb & = 10^{15}  \cdot b
\end{align*}
$$

**Binary Number System**:

$$\beta_n 2^n + \beta_{n-1} 2^n-1 + ... + \beta_0 2^0$$

>**Memory Slot Unit**  
>Byte $B = 8b$

## Network Topologies  

- **Bus Line**: a single communication channel with multiple branching communcation channels, each branch connects a communication node to the same collision domain, thus they most operate in half duplex mode. And typically pass around a token to decide who can transmit  
- **Ring Line**: Take a bus line but rather than having branching channels, each communcation node is connected with two other nodes, (circular linked list)  
- **FDDI Ring**: Use two rings using trasmitting opposite directions, in order to add redudnacy in case one ring fails.  
- **Full Mesh**: Connect every node with everyother node, this allows for 1 on 1 communcation but requires $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ communcation channels  
- **Star Topology**: Use a centerailized communcication node in order to connect route all communcation through this device.  
- **Hub & Spoke**: connect two or more star topoglies(hubs) together in order to be able to reach evrey other node ( spokes) via the hubs  
- **Partial Mesh**: take the frequently used spokes and link them to other frequently used spokes in order to add redudacny in the case a hub fails, travel to every other node is still possible.  

## Hierarchal Network Tiers

- **PAN**: Personal Area Network
  - scale: connecting 2 nodes within a close proximity

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 8 Bytes  |     6 Bytes     | 6 Bytes    | 2 Bytes | 46-1500 Bytes| 4 Bytes|

**Policy**:

- **Deterministic**: Each node in a collision domain knows when its their turn to transmit,
  - **Protocols**:
    - Time Divison Multiple Access: Multiplex by allocating time to each node
    - Stat DMA: Multiplex by allocating time but based on node usage
    - Frequency DMA: Multiplex by allocating a frequency range to nodes

- **Contention**: Each node listens for a gap in order to start transmitting ( what the interent uses )
  - **Protocols**:
    - **Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection CSMA**:
      - When their is a gap attempt to transmit, if collision occurs, backoff and try again

**Interface**:Network Interface Card (NIC) exists at node and made up of a controller to interact with computer and a transmitter to send out signals  
**Adressing**: Media Access Control (MAC) unique identifier which comes with each network card

- **Space**: $2^{48} $ possible MAC addresses, IEEE assigns the first 24 bits to a manufacturer and manufacturere assigns last 24 to their cards
- **notation**: the 48 bits are respresented by 6 pairs of hexadecimal numbers, each pair represents a 8 bits ( 1 Byte )

    - e.g: 192.168.1.4 - 11000000 10101000 00000001 00000100
  - **Subnet Mask**: is a 32 bit number used to define the network bits vs the hosts bits
  - **CIDR Notation**: rather than passing around both a IPV4 and subnet mask around, short hand < IPV4 address/<# of network bits
    - e.g: 192.168.1.4/24
  - **IPV4 Class Tpes**: IPV4 address fall under one of 5 classes, this is dependent on their first byte and defualt subnet mask
    - e.g Class E: reserved IP starting byte betweem 240-255 with a no default mask
      - reserved for expirmental research

 **Public IPV4 class table**:
|Class | First byte range | default mask | Possible host|
|------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| A    |  1 - 127         | 255.0.0.0    | 16.7 million |
| B    | 128 - 191        | 255.255.0.0  | 65,536       |
| C    | 192 - 223        | 255.255.255.0| 256          |
| D    | 225 - 239        |   null       |              |
| E    | 240 - 255        |  null        | 268 million  |

- **IPV6**: $ 2^{128} $ addressing space, can map multiple IP's per NIC

    - e.g: 2018:8888:0000:0000:0000:0000:48AB:54AE
      - shorthand: 2018:8::48AB:54AE
        - if a group has the name number, you can write 1 number instead
        - if a series of groups are 0's you can close the series, :: once.

- **DHCP**: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol runs on a server ( usually on the router), and is in charge for auto fully configuring devices.
- **DNS**: Domain Name System core functionality is to translate ip address to domain names. If a server can't find a tranlation, it keeps moving up the chain of routers until a tranlation is found.

 **Domain Name http: //www.my-domain-name .com/pathTofile**:
 |http:// | www | my-domain-name|.com | /path to file |
 |--------|-----|---------------|-----|---------------|
 | service| subdomain|root domain | top level domain|  |

**Data Flow**:

- **Unicast**: from one node to another
- **multicast**:from one node to a group
- **broadcast**: frome one node to everynode in network

$ subnets = 2^s $ where s is the number of barrowed bits  
$CIDR = 32 - \lceil log_{2}(users+2) \rceil $  
$ assignable IP = 2^h -2 $ where h is the number host bits
 first IP address is used as the network ID  
 last IP is used as a broadcast ID, for every subnet

**Subnetting ref table**:
 | CIDR | subnets |total IPS per sub net|
 |------|---------|--------------------|
 |  /24 |    1    |    256  |
 | /25  |    2    |    128  |
 | /26  |    4    |    64   |
 | /27  |    8    |    32   |
 | /28  |    16   |    16   |

  - Server: pushes it new data when new data for the client exists
  - client: listens for new data
- **Short Polling**:
  - client: Sends a long request
  - server: responds with a url handle,which will show status of the request
  - client: polls uses handle to request for status updates
  - server: handles each handle request immediatly
- **Long Polling**:
  - same as short polling but instead of the server handling each handle request, it ignores it until it has a response

## Network Attacks

**DOS**: Denial of Service Attack,machine is flooded with requests

- TCP Syn Flood: attacker inints TCP connection but doesn't allow it to establish
- Smurf Attack: Attacker sends ping to subnet with spoofed IP sever

**DDOS**: Destributed Denial of Service Attack, when attcekr uses multiple computers to flood a server w/ request at the same time

**Botnet**: Comporomised computers(zombie) under control of a master node

**On-Path / Man in the Middle Attack (MITM)**: attacker intercepts outgoing request from victim

**Session Hijacking**: Attacker guesses sessionID, used to authenticate users, thus has granted himself an authorization

**DNS Poisoining**: Attacker manipulates known vulnerablilites within the DNS to reroute traffic from one site to a fake version of that site

- **DNSSEC**: Encrypt DNS signals to prevent posioning

***Always ensure to be on the latest patch / firmware**

**IP Spoofing**: modifying the source address of an IP packet to hide the ID of the sender or impersonate anohter client

**MAC Spoofing**: Change MAC address to prentend to be another device

**ARP Spoofing**:Sending falsified ARP messages over a LAN

**VLAN Hopping**: attacker bypasses VLAN segmentation and is able to send traffic between VLANs

**Switch Spoofing**: Attacker attempts to conduct DTP negotiation

**Malware**: designed to inflitrate a computer system and posssible damage it without users knowledge

**Virus**: malicious code that is run on a machinewithout the users knowlege and infect it whenever that code runs ( requires user to install)

**Worm**: software that can replicate itself without user interaction

**Trojan Horse**: Software desguised as a harmlesss software, seems like it does what you expect it to do

**Remote Access Trojan**: Provides attacker with remote access to control the victim machine

**Ransomware**: Restricts access to victims computer system or files until a ransom or payment is recieved

**Spyware**: Gathers information about you without your consent

**Key logger**: Captures any key strokes made on a machine

**Rogue Access Point**: unsecured installed WAP unknown to local admin

**Shadow IT**: Use of IT systems, devices, software, application or services without the approval of IT

**Evil Twin**: WAP with the same name as another

**Deauthentication**: Interrupts communication between end user and WAP

**Dictionary Attack**: Guessed passeword by brute force

**Wireless Interception**: intercept wireless packets then cracking encryption later on

**Social Engineering Attack**: Non technical way of breaking into a network/ obtainng access to resources

- e.g manipulating current employee to give you their credentials, dumpster diving

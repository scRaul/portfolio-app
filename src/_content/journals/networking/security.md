## Network Security

**CIA Triad**:

- **Confedentaility**: encrypt data, auth users
  - **Symmetric Key Protocoles**:
    - **DES 56**: bit encryption symmetrice key
    - **Tripple DES**: 3 key encryption
    - **AES**: [ 128, 192, 256 ] bit keys
    - ***Pitfall**: key manangement,
  - **Integrety**: data was not modefied en route
    - **Hashing Protocols**:
      - **MD5**: 128 bits
      - **SHA-1**: 160 bit
      - **SHA-256**: 256 bit
- **Accessibility**: How avaiblable is the network

**Threat**: Person or thng who can take you down  
**Vulnability**: characterstic that allows a threat to exists  
**Risk**: How real is the threat and how vulnarable is the vulnability  
**Internal**: insider threat by accidnet or on purpose  
**Extenral**: Hacker or envioroment  
**CVE**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure  

- List of publically discovered computer security weaknesses

**Zero Day**: A new vulnerabliity no one has reported publically yet

**Risk Management**: Identify and prioritze risks

- Risk Assesment: identify potential hazards and what would happen if it comes to be
- Security Assesment: A security controlls whitin MITRE app/system / network

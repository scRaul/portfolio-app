## The Cloud

**4 major categories of cloud networks**:

- Private: Isolated cloud network
- Public: Open to public networks such as the Internet
- Hybrid: some parts privat other public
- Community: Open to a collaborative effor betweeen orgs and communities

**5 Models of clould computing**:

- NaasS: Netowrking as a service
- Iaas: Infastructure as a service ( aws, azure)
- SaaS: Software as a service ( Office 365 )
- DaaS: Desktop as a service
- PasS: Platform as a service

**5 Cloud Concepts**:

- Elestic: Flexible architecture,adjust to meet real time demand
- Scalability: Designs ability to expand over time
- Vertical Scaling: Upgrade current hardware for increased performance
- Horizontal Scaling: Add more hardware to decrease average load
- Multitenancy: Share resources with other orgs / devs

**Infastrucutre as Code**: Scripts meant for automating and orchestrating tasks suchs as running a script to update software on various pieces of code  
**Snowflake System**: A system that was built offspec from the rest, this is a potential source of issues  
**VPN**: Virtual Private Network, establish a secure connection b/w client and remote server

**Types of cloud storage**:

- NAS: Network Attatched storage
- SAN: Storage Area network
- FC: Fiber Channel
- IP: Small computer systen interface

**Software Defined Networking**: a networking managable w/ software

- Layer of abstractions:
  - App Layer: focus on computing resources, allows request about the network
  - Control Layer: defines how packets are to be routed
  - Infastructure: contains the network devices that recieve information where to nake the data and perform these moves
  - Managment Plan: oversees the network and where tomake config changes

**Traffic Flow**:

- North-South: Traffice Exiting or entering the network
- East-West: Traffice flow within the network

## OSI Model and IEEE

**Open Systems Intercommuncation Model**: is a conceptual framework used to standardize and facilitate the repsosibilites of network devices and applications, it does so by spreading the responsibilties across 7 layers.

- **Layer 7**: Application
- **Layer 6**: Presentation  
- **Layer 5**: Session  
- **Layer 4**: Trasnport  
- **Layer 3**: Network  
- **Layer 2**: Link
- **Layer 1**: Physical

**Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers**: Develop and maintain standards of networking technologies ensuring interopablitly and compatitbiltiy among different devices and vendors.  

- e.g standards include: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) and Wifi (IEEE 802.11)
